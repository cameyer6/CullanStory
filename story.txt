Once upon a time in an isolated forest there lived a rabbit named Timmothy. Every morning Timmothy would hop down to a crystal clear lake where his favorite clover patch grew and feast on the delicious plants. One day, a fox named Pedro visited this forest. Pedro hadn't eaten anything yet, and, suddenly, he found Timmothy.
Timmothy noticed that Pedro was staring at him and started to run. Pedro started to chase after Timmothy, but was only trying to tell him that he didn't have pants on. Pedro was so angry that this rabit had the audacity to be hopping around like nothing is wrong. Timmothy tripped and pedro caught up. Pedro had a crazy look in his eyes while he was looking straight in the eyes of Timmothy trying his hardest to not look down. Pedro yelled "PUT ON SOME PANTS".
Timmothy stared blankly for a moment as he processed what Pedro had said. When he finally realized what had happened he let out a sigh of relief and explained that he was a nudist. Pedro thought that was kind of awkward so he decided to leave.
