Once upon a time in an isolated forest there lived a rabbit named Timmothy. Every morning Timmothy would hop down to a crystal clear lake where his favorite clover patch grew and feast on the delicious plants. One day, a fox named Pedro visited this forest. Pedro hadn't eaten anything yet, and, suddenly, he found Timmothy.
